# UnhackableWallet Monad Integration Summary

We have successfully set up the UnhackableWallet smart contract for deployment on the Monad testnet. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

## 1. Hardhat Configuration

- Added Monad testnet to `hardhat.config.ts` with chain ID 2023
- Configured custom RPC URL: `https://rpc.testnet.monad.xyz`
- Set up Monad Explorer API for contract verification

## 2. Deployment Scripts

- Created a main deployment script (`deploy.ts`) compatible with Monad
- Added a Monad-specific test script (`test-monad-deployment.js`) to verify deployment
- Created an automated deployment workflow script (`monad-deploy-workflow.js`) that guides you through the entire process

## 3. Frontend Integration

- Added Monad network information to the frontend in `utils.ts`
- Implemented network switching functionality in `wallet.ts`
- Created a React component (`MonadNetworkSwitcher.tsx`) for easy network switching
- Updated contract.ts to include Monad contract address

## 4. Documentation

- Created detailed Monad deployment guide (`MONAD_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- Added a step-by-step guide for deployment (`MONAD_STEP_BY_STEP.md`)
- Created frontend integration instructions (`MONAD_INTEGRATION.md`)
- Updated the main README to highlight Monad as the recommended network

## 5. NPM Scripts

Added the following scripts to `package.json`:
- `deploy:monad`: Deploy to Monad testnet
- `verify:monad`: Verify contract on Monad Explorer
- `test:monad`: Test contract on Monad testnet
- `monad:workflow`: Run the interactive deployment workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the contract** to Monad testnet:
   ```powershell
   cd hardhat
   npm run monad:workflow
   ```

2. **Test the deployment** with your frontend by connecting to Monad testnet in MetaMask

3. **Update your documentation** with the deployed contract address and test results

4. **Monitor performance** to see the benefits of Monad's faster block times and lower gas fees

## Benefits of Monad for UnhackableWallet

- **Faster Transactions**: Monad's quick block times mean scam reports and DAO votes are processed much faster
- **Lower Gas Fees**: Users pay less for transactions, making the wallet more accessible
- **Scale**: Monad's high throughput can handle a large number of users and transactions
- **Future-proof**: As a modern Layer-1, Monad provides a solid foundation for future features

The UnhackableWallet is now ready for deployment on Monad testnet, providing enhanced security with the performance benefits of Monad's architecture.
